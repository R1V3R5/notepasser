# Notepasser

Pass notes to your friends with HTTP and ruby!

## Usage

Run `bundle exec camping -s webrick -h YOUR_IP_ADDRESS lib/notepasser.rb`
to get the server running. Have your friends write a client to send you
messages with HTTParty. Add a short two to three line decription to this
file's "API Calls" section whenever you add support for an API call.

The description should include the HTTP method to use,
the route, and any parameters and what they do.
